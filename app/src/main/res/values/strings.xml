    <string name="desc_manual_sampling">If the rover is not present, follow these steps to collect the soil sample and test it using sensors:\n\nFor crops based on their depth 9 inches to 12 inches. Take uniform soil samples of one-inch thickness from about 10 different locations using a spade or shovel and mix them in a plastic container.\n\n● The collected soil sample should be dried naturally in shade.\n● Make a heap of the soil sample and divide it into four equal parts. Remove two opposite parts and again mix the remaining soil. Repeat this process until about half kg of soil sample is obtained.\n● Label the collected sample properly with complete details. Do not dry the label.\n\n<b>Best Time to Collect Soil Sample</b>\n● After harvest – Before applying fertilizers\n\n<b>When Soil Sample Should Not Be Collected</b>\n● From protected or wet areas near canals\n● Under trees or from pits\n● From areas where fertilizers have been applied\n● Immediately after applying fertilizers\n● From waste or garbage areas</string>
